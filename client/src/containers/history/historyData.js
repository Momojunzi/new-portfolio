    text: `Dong Haichuan (1797 or 1813 – 1882) was born in Zhu village, Hebei Province, China. He is regarded as a skillful martial artist and is widely credited to be the founder of Baguazhang. Most, if not all, existing schools of Baguazhang place Dong Haichuan at the beginning of their lineage.
           He is said to have learned from Taoist (and possibly Buddhist) masters in the mountains of rural China during the early 19th century. There is evidence to suggest a synthesis of several pre-existing martial arts taught and practised in the region in which Dong Haichuan lived, combined with Taoist circle walking. Because of his work as a servant in the Imperial Palace he impressed the emperor with his graceful movements and fighting skill, and became an instructor and a body guard to the court. Dong Haichuan taught for many years in Beijing, eventually earning patronage by the Imperial court.`,

    text: `Yin Fu (Chinese: 尹福; pinyin: Yǐn Fú) (Chanhuaicun (漳淮村), Jixian (冀县), China, 1840 – China, June, 1909) was a Baguazhang (a martial art) disciple of Dong Haichuan responsible for the creation of the Yin Style Baguazhang.

Yin Fu was Dong's earliest disciple in Prince Duan's palace. Yin's kungfu skills advanced very fast during the next several years and Duan let Yin join the king's security guards.

When Master Dong retired, Yin took over as the supervisor of the security guards, working for the emperor in the Forbidden City. The Empress Dowager liked his skill and even wanted to study with him.

Yin taught Bagua and lived on the eastern side of Beijing city; as a result, the Yin style of kungfu is called Dong-cheng Zhang (Eastern City Palm). The other name for the Yin style is Niu-she Zhang (Ox Tongue Palm) because the palm's shape in this style looks like an ox tongue. Yin style Bagua Zhang includes eight sections, each with eight postures. The sixty-four posture palm change is practiced in circle walking.

Later some of Yin's students changed their style. They did eight palm changes as a major practice. This approach is similar to Cheng style.`,

text: `Cheng Tinghua (1848 - 1900) was the fourth disciple of Dong Haichuan. He owned an eyeglass shop in Beijing, so some called him Eyeglasses Cheng. During the Boxer Movement (July 1900) Cheng saw the invading armies killing and looting throughout Beijing. Upset at what was happening to his country, he swore to defend it. One day, Cheng Tinghua subdued ten of the looting soldiers before they ordered a patrol with rifles to surround him. Cheng used his Baguazhang skills to calmly            evade the soldiers and leaped onto a wall where he started to walk away. The soldiers shot him dead.
          Before he started studying with Dong Haichuan, Cheng Tinghua had an extensive background in Shuaijiao (Chinese Wrestling); therefore, Cheng Style Baguazhang is known for its throwing techniques. The hand is held in the Dragon Claw formation with the thumb spread wide, the tiger's mouth curved up, the second, third, and fourth fingers are slightly spread apart, and the little finger and fourth finger held together.`,

    text: `Liang Zhen Pu (1863-1932) was Dong Haichuan’s youngest student. He came from the Jixian county of Hebei province. He studied Tan Tui (a kicking style) from age 7 to 14. In 1877, his father sent him to study with Dong Haichuan. He studied with Dong for the next five years and also learned from Cheng Ting Hua , Yin Fu, Shih Chi Tung, and Liu Feng Chun. After the revolution of 1911, Liang became a head of Guard Bureau and later on some of his teachings were published. Pu is the only student of Dong Hai Chuan to be buried next to his tomb.
    In Liang Zhen Pu Baguazhang, there is only one kind of walking technique, and it is known as Tang Ni Bu or Mud Sliding Step. This is a fluid walking technique that resembles the motion of sliding on soft mud or clay. His Liang Zhen Pu Baguazhang had little influence from other styles and is most circular in nature among the Bagua variants. Every one of his sets are taught in a circle, unlike versions from earlier students.`,
